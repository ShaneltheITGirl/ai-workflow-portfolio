# Shanel Henry — AI Workflow Automation Portfolio

**Focus:** AI + automation for back-office workflows (Finance/Accounting, Claims, HR, Payroll) in regulated environments.  
**Target roles:** Product Manager (Back-Office Platforms) • AI Workflow Consultant • Business Systems Analyst • ERP/CRM Admin

This mini-portfolio showcases three strengths aligned to enterprise back-office platforms:
1. **Translate business needs into system requirements** → see the *Vendor Invoice Approval & 3-Way Match* BRD.
2. **Own/administer systems and deliver automation** → see the *Google Sheets + Apps Script* invoice approval demo.
3. **Governance, compliance & data integrity** → see the *Controls, RBAC, and Data Dictionary* examples.

A NetSuite readiness section maps the above artifacts to NetSuite concepts (GL, AP/AR, SuiteFlow, Saved Searches, roles).
